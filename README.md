# Bosh release for Shipyard

One of the fastest ways to get [Shipyard](http://shipyard-project.com/) and manage multiple [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) hosts on any virtual infrastructure is to deploy this BOSH release.

## Disclaimer

This is not presently a production ready [Shipyard](http://shipyard-project.com/) BOSH release. This is a work in progress.

This BOSH release needs a [BOSH stemcell](http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io/file_collections?type=stemcells) with a embedded Linux kernel >= 3.8, so be sure to use one of the public stemcells that come with Ubuntu Trusty.

## Usage

### Upload the BOSH release

To use this BOSH release, first upload it to your BOSH:

```
bosh target BOSH_HOST
git clone https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/shipyard-boshrelease.git
cd shipyard-boshrelease
bosh upload release releases/shipyard-3.yml
```

### Create a BOSH deployment manifest

Now create a deployment file (using the files at the [examples](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/shipyard-boshrelease/tree/master/examples) directory as a starting point) and deploy:

```
vi path/to/deployment.yml
```

Note that the examples requires you to open some ports, so you will need to:

* Create a security group (or the equivalent) named `bosh` with the following ports opened:
    - TCP `22`, `4222`, `6868`, `25250`, `25555`, `25777` to enable BOSH to communicate with the agents
    - UDP `53` to enable using the BOSH DNS
* Create a security group (or the equivalent) named `shipyard` (or the name of your deployment) with the following ports opened:
    - TCP `8000` for Shipyard UI
    - TCP `80` & `443` for applications

### Deploy using the BOSH deployment manifest

Using the previous created deployment manifest, now we can deploy it:

```
bosh deployment path/to/deployment.yml
bosh -n deploy
```

## Create new final release

If you need to create a new final release, you will need to get read/write API credentials to the [@cloudfoundry-community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community) s3 account.

Please email [Dr Nic Williams](mailto:&#x64;&#x72;&#x6E;&#x69;&#x63;&#x77;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6D;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) and he will create unique API credentials for you.

Create a `config/private.yml` file with the following contents:

``` yaml
---
blobstore:
  s3:
    access_key_id:     ACCESS
    secret_access_key: PRIVATE
```

You can now create final releases for everyone to enjoy!

```
bosh create release
# test this dev release
git commit -m "updated shipyard"
bosh create release --final
git commit -m "creating vXYZ release"
git tag vXYZ
git push origin master --tags
```
